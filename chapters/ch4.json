Aiming my shots would be much more difficult in the forest, because of all the trees in my way. And besides, with the fear they had in their eyes, I doubt they'll be bothering us any longer.<br/>There's a slow sound of clapping hands coming from the trees. Looking to see what's making the sound, I see Eiden, leaning against a pine tree with his usual smile on his face.<br/><br/>\"Impressive, Barry,\" he says. \"You don't often see stat boosters used so efficiently these days!\"<br/><br/>You!!!\" Daren shouts, and he rushes towards the stillwater.<br/><br/>Once again, with one gesture of his hands, Eiden puts Daren to sleep in the middle of his sprint, which makes him fall on the ground and slide on his armor for a few feet before coming to a halt.<br/><br/>\"Seriously, this is getting ridiculous,\" Eiden says.<br/><br/>\"You know about stat boosters too?\" I ask the stillwater.<br/><br/>\"I do! And what I also know is why that stat booster works so well for you, specifically. Have you ever wondered why that is, Barry?\"<br/><br/>He's right. The stat device has performed beyond all of my expectations since I got here. I didn't really give it much thought since I figured my calculations must have been wrong. But even with all of the energy it's accumulating, something is still clearly off.<br/><br/><br/><% } %><% if(v_ch4_dave_defeat == 2) {%>\"You know about stat boosters too?\" I ask the stillwater.<br/>\"I do!
