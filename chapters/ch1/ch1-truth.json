It's been my dream ever since I was little to become a mage, and the Magium can grant me that wish.\"<br/>\"Come on, Barry. You're going to have to make up a better lie than that if you want me to believe you!\"<br/><br/>He stops and looks me straight in the eye.<br/><br/>\"By the gods... You are being serious! Barry, I commend your bravery and determination but... You do realize you can't win this entire tournament just by bluffing, don't you?\"<br/><br/>\"Of course I know that! That's not the only ace I have up my sleeve. But what about you? They say you are one of the strongest mages in the world. So how does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, that...\"<br/><br/>He is sounding embarrassed.<br/><br/>\"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly...\"<br/><br/>\"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?\"<br/><br/><br/>",
