I promise I won't let any harm come to you until you achieve your goal!\"<br/><br/>\"Not to sound ungrateful but... I'm not finding this very reassuring. I mean, I did just witness you get completely wrecked by that knife throwing guy. How does one as strong as you get bested so easily by someone named Cutthroat Dave, anyway?\"<br/><br/>\"Oh, that...\"<br/><br/>He is sounding embarrassed.<br/><br/>\"You see, Barry. I may be powerful, but that doesn't mean I don't have weaknesses. It turns out one of those weaknesses is that I never really managed to master the shield spell properly...\"<br/><br/>\"The shield spell? The one that casts an invisible protective layer around yourself? But isn't that one of the first spells any mage learns?\"<br/><br/><br/>",
