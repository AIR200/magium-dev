I would have expected to feel at least a little bit scared about all of this. But instead of that, I get this constant tingling sensation that won't go away. The feeling that I am closer to my dream than ever before in my life.  All of the terrible dangers that await me seem distant to me, and all I can  really think about now is that at the end of the tournament, when I win this, I will finally become a mage.<br/>There's an explosion maybe a few hundred feet from my location. The fights have already begun. And one of them is much closer to me than I would have hoped. There's no way I can get in a fight with any of the mages at this point. I need to avoid combat for as long as possible if I am to survive until the end.<br/><br/>I head in the opposite direction from where I've heard the explosion. As I am heading towards the end of the forest, I start hearing voices. There are two mages talking in a clearing a few feet away from me. I hide behind a tree and take a quick glance towards the clearing. <br/><br/>It seems the two mages have just finished fighting. One of them has the appearance of an ordinary thug. He is wearing a simple stained white shirt, leather pants and a belt full of throwing knives. His untrimmed black beard hides a wicked smile. Just by seeing the confidence in his eyes, I can clearly tell he is the victor of the skirmish. The other mage is wearing heavy armor, but his shield lies on the ground besides him and he is barely holding his sword anymore.<br/><br/><br/><% } %><% if(v_ch1_intro_feeling == 2) {%>...calm about this whole thing. It must be because I've been getting mentally prepared for this for so long. Or maybe I'm just stronger than I thought myself to be. But even in the face of the mortal danger that awaits me, even against these impossible odds, I feel confident. I know I can do this. I am going to win this tournament and become a mage. I cannot allow myself to fail.<br/>There's an explosion maybe a few hundred feet from my location. The fights have already begun. And one of them is much closer to me than I would have hoped.

Deep down, I always knew this would happen. I've been spending the past few weeks getting mentally prepared and making plans. Telling myself I was ready for whatever this tournament is going to throw at me. But once I got here, once I knew there was no way for me to go back, all of my confidence turned to uncertainty, and all of my courage turned to fear. I am going up against the strongest mages in the world. No amount of planning could ever really make me prepared for this. But it's too late to change my mind now. I've had enough time to back out of this before coming here. I am going to win this tournament against all odds. I'm going to do it.
