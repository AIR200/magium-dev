One of them has the appearance of an ordinary thug. He is wearing a simple stained white shirt, leather pants and a belt full of throwing knives. His untrimmed black beard hides a wicked smile. Just by seeing the confidence in his eyes, I can clearly tell he is the victor of the skirmish. The other mage is wearing heavy armor, but his shield lies on the ground besides him and he is barely holding his sword anymore.<br/>Taking a closer look at the mage in armor, I notice his head is bald, his skin is dark, he is likely in his mid forties and he has a scar on his forehead, shaped like an 'X'.
