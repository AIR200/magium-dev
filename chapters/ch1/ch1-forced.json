All I can do now is try to survive until the end of the tournament.\"<br/>Daren pauses a little to reflect on my words.<br/><br/>\"Hold on, Barry...

You just need to find any of the humans living on this continent, try to punch them in the face, and you'll be set free!\"<br/><br/>\"I..uh... I never thought of it this way.\"<br/><br/><br/>",
