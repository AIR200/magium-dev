Otherwise that spell of theirs would have alerted us the moment we sensed your presence.\"<br/><br/>He is talking about the spell the organizers of the tournament cast on each of the participants before teleporting us here. We aren't allowed to hurt the humans that live on this continent, so their spell warns us when one of them is near. If what they said can be believed, their spell is supposed to stop us even before we try hurting any of the locals. If it's accidental then it simply stops us before doing it. If it's intentional, it eliminates us from the tournament and sends us back. <br/><br/>Their spell is also supposed to act as a means of communication with the organizers. They said they'll transmit the objectives to each of us individually. It's funny. All of those careful preparations on their side, and they never even bothered to check if I was a mage or not. Hell, what am I saying? They probably didn't even care.<br/><br/>\"So you must be a participant, then,\" Daren continues. \"What reason would you have to participate in a tournament against the most powerful mages in the world?\"<br/><br/>I am after the same thing as every other participant in this tournament, Daren, but I'm not sure how wise it would be to tell you of this. <br/><br/><br/>",
